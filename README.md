# latest-commit

## About

A demo on using github's v3 api and getting commit info from a repo.

## Requirements

It requires React and Babel 7.xx (for jsx).

But is already included in index.html as external libraries.

## Development

I recommend [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension on VS-Code to develop.
